# Rule Matching and Application

This document describes the rule matching and application algorithms implemented in `src/index.ts`. It covers the structural rules a drawing must satisfy to be a rule, the backtracking matcher used to find rule applications in a host drawing, and the first- and second-order application procedures.

All algorithms enforce the `Layer Hierarchy Rule`: an artefact in layer `L` can only depend on artefacts in layer `L` or any lower ancestor layer (parent, grandparent, root).

---

## 1. Rule Structure (`checkRuleStructure`, `checkRuleConditions`)

Before a drawing can be used as a rule it must be explicitly marked with `setIsRule(true)`, which validates four structural conditions:

1. **At most one root layer** (`parentId === null`).
2. **Maximum depth 3** — layers form a tree of height at most 3.
3. **Exactly one child layer of the root that has no children** — this is the **conclusion layer**. The conclusion is merged into the host when the rule is applied.
4. **Each child layer of the root has at most one child layer** — the other children of the root are **premise layers**, each with at most one grandchild layer.

A drawing that satisfies these conditions but has only one child layer of the root is a **first-order** rule. A drawing whose root has two or more child layers is a **second-order** rule (`isFirstOrder` is derived from the layer structure).

---

## 2. Rule Applications (`findRuleApplications*`)

The public entry points are:

| Function | Requires | Pattern used for matching |
|---|---|---|
| `findRuleApplications(rule, host, options?)` | Any valid rule | All non-`Equality` artefacts of the rule |
| `findFirstOrderRuleApplications(rule, host, options?)` | Root has **exactly one** child layer | **Root-layer** artefacts only |
| `findSecondOrderRuleApplications(rule, host, options?)` | Root has **at least two** child layers | **Root-layer** artefacts only |

All three validate the rule first (`validateRuleDrawing`); they return `[]` if the layer-count preconditions are not met. They share `findRootRuleApplications(rule, host, options)`, which:

- takes the root-layer artefacts (excluding `Equality`) as the pattern, and
- extracts equality constraints from the **root-layer** equality artefacts (`extractEqualityConstraints`).

> **Important:** only the rule's **root layer** participates in matching. Child-layer artefacts and child-layer equalities are part of the rule's structure (the conclusion/premises), not of its pattern. In particular, a child-layer equality is never required to be provable in the host.

### Matching options

The optional `options` argument controls two independent aspects of the matcher:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `injective` | `true` | Do **not** allow two different rule artefacts to be matched to the same host artefact. When `false`, distinct pattern artefacts may alias a single host artefact (e.g. a rule with two vertices matches a host with one vertex, mapping both to it). |
| `flexible` | `false` | Allow the match to be **bigger than the rule root layer**. When `true`, a candidate's dependencies may be **provably equal** to (rather than identical with) the already-matched images, and applications whose images are provably equal are collapsed. For example, a rule root layer consisting of a looping arrow on a vertex `A` matches a host root layer with two provably equal vertices `B` and `C` and an edge between them: the edge `B → C` is a match for the loop `A → A`. |

The rule-root equality constraints (§2.1) are always required regardless of `flexible`: a root-layer equality in the rule demands that its matched images be provably equal in the host.

Each returned `RuleApplication` contains:
- `matchedArtefacts`: a map from each pattern artefact to a host artefact;
- `hostArtefacts`: the set of host artefacts consumed by the match (all matched images plus every dependency of those images).

### 2.1 Equality constraints (`extractEqualityConstraints`)

Root-layer equality artefacts express that their children are provably equal in the host. During matching, the constraint holds only when the assigned host images are pairwise provably equal (see §2.4). Constraints whose children are not all part of the pattern are ignored.

### 2.2 The matcher (`findRuleApplicationsInternal`)

1. **Candidate pool** (`hostCandidates`): every host artefact that lives in a host **root layer**.
2. **Topological ordering**: pattern artefacts are ordered so that every artefact appears before any artefact that depends on it (dependencies first). If the pattern cannot be fully ordered this way, matching is impossible.
3. **Backtracking assignment** over the ordered pattern artefacts, with the following per-candidate checks:
   - the candidate's `sortName` must equal the pattern artefact's;
   - each host artefact may be used at most once when `injective` is `true` (the default); when it is `false`, distinct pattern artefacts may map to the same host artefact;
   - **artefact dependencies**: every dependency of a pattern artefact is a real artefact:
     - if the dependency has already been assigned a host image, the candidate's dependency must be that image itself, or — when `flexible` is `true` — provably equal to it;
     - if the dependency is not part of the pattern (e.g. it lives in a lower ancestor layer), the candidate's dependency must be that same host artefact, or provably equal to it when `flexible`;
     - the candidate must have every dependency of the pattern artefact defined.
4. **Final check**: once a complete assignment is found, every applicable equality constraint must hold — the assigned images must be pairwise equal via `host.areEqual`.
5. **Deduplication**: when `flexible` is `true`, two applications are considered equivalent when every pattern artefact maps to the same host artefact or to host artefacts that are provably equal (`applicationsEquivalent`). Only one representative of each equivalence class is returned. When `flexible` is `false`, applications collapse only if every pattern artefact maps to exactly the same host artefact.

### 2.3 Redundancy Filtering

The user interface includes a "Filter redundant matches" option that uses `filterRedundantRuleApplications` to further deduplicate matches based on their *effect* on the host drawing. 

Two matches are redundant if applying the rule produces the exact same host state (e.g. if the rule creates an edge between two matched vertices, and two distinct matches map to the exact same pair of host vertices but differ only on a matched edge that the conclusion never references). The filter simulates `applyRuleConclusion` structurally to generate a canonical string effect key using host-artefact identities, removing functionally identical duplicates.

### 2.4 `areEqual` — provable equality in the host

`Drawing.areEqual(a, b, layerId)` decides whether `a` and `b` are **provably equal** at a given layer:

1. If `a === b`, they are equal.
2. It builds an undirected adjacency graph from all **equality artefacts** that live in the allowed ancestor layers of `layerId` (the layer's ancestors including itself). Each equality artefact connects all of its children pairwise.
3. `a` and `b` are equal iff they are in the same connected component (breadth-first search from `a` reaches `b`).

Equality is therefore only visible from layers at or below the layer where the equality artefact was declared (the Layer Hierarchy Rule).

---

## 3. Host Root Resolution (`resolveHostRootId`)

When applying a rule, the target host root layer is determined from the match:

- Collect the layer ids of the matched host images used as dependencies of the rule's artefacts (`match.get(dep).layerId`).
- If exactly **one** distinct host root layer is referenced, that layer is the target.
- If **none** is referenced, the first host root layer is used.
- If **multiple** distinct roots are referenced, a `Consistency Check Failed` error is thrown ("Matched artefacts span multiple root layers").

---

## 4. Application

Application is shared between first- and second-order rules through `applyRuleConclusion(rule, host, application, childLayer)`. It merges a rule's child layer into the host root and returns `{ artefacts, created }`:

- `artefacts` — the newly created host artefacts (the conclusion content);
- `created` — a map from each rule conclusion artefact to its host copy.

### 4.1 Conclusion content

Every non-`Equality` artefact in the conclusion layer is created in the host root as a fresh copy, with its dependencies resolved against the match. This includes tag artefacts such as `isMono`: an `isMono` artefact in the conclusion layer produces a new `isMono` artefact in the host root pointing at the matched host artefact. Conclusion artefacts are never part of the rule's pattern, so they neither constrain matching (§2.2) nor need to pre-exist in the host.

### 4.2 Conclusion artefact creation

1. The conclusion-layer artefacts (excluding `Equality`) are created in the host root **in dependency order**:
   - dependencies on rule root-layer artefacts resolve to their matched host images;
   - dependencies on other conclusion artefacts resolve to the copies already created.
2. The rule's **child-layer equalities** are re-created in the host root with the same resolution rules, using `addEqualityArtefactUnchecked` (no re-validation) and skipping any that collapse to fewer than two distinct children.

### 4.3 First-order application (`applyFirstOrderRule`)

1. Validates the rule structure and conditions; requires the root to have **exactly one** child layer (the conclusion).
2. Calls `applyRuleConclusion` with that single child layer.
3. Returns the created host artefacts (`artefacts`).

### 4.4 Second-order application (`applySecondOrderRule`)

The root has at least two child layers: the **conclusion** (the unique childless child of the root) and one or more **premise layers** (each with at most one child layer).

**Step 1 — conclusion into the host.** `applyRuleConclusion` is called with the conclusion layer. The host root receives the conclusion artefacts (including any conclusion-layer tag artefacts). The result records which host artefacts were created (`conclusionCreated`) so they can be excluded from the derived drawings.

**Step 2 — one derived drawing per premise layer.** For each premise layer `A`:

1. Resolve the host root for `A` (`resolveHostRootId`).
2. Create a new empty `Drawing` (not marked as a rule — `isRule` stays `false`).
3. **Copy the host root** into the derived root as a standalone snapshot:
   - non-`Equality` host root artefacts are copied in dependency order; every host artefact maps 1:1 to a fresh derived artefact;
   - artefacts created by the conclusion (Step 1) are **excluded**;
   - host root equality artefacts are copied (again excluding conclusion-created ones), re-resolved against the copies.
4. **Instantiate premise layer `A`** in the derived root:
   - dependencies on rule root artefacts resolve to the *copies* of the matched host images (`origToCopy`);
   - dependencies on other premise-`A` artefacts resolve to already-created premise copies;
   - premise equalities are copied the same way.
5. **Add the child layer `B` of `A`** (at most one, by rule condition 4) as a child of the derived root, and instantiate layer `B`'s artefacts and equalities there, resolving dependencies against the derived-root copies, premise copies, or other `B` copies as appropriate.
6. The derived drawing is named `"<hostName> > <ruleName> > <premiseName>"` when an optional `names: { hostName, ruleName }` argument is passed to `applySecondOrderRule`; otherwise it falls back to the bare premise layer name. It is returned as `{ name, drawing }`.

The function returns `{ hostArtefacts, derivedRules }`, where `hostArtefacts` is the conclusion content created in the host root and `derivedRules` is one entry per premise layer.

## 5. Summary of rules of thumb

- **Only the rule's root layer matches.** Everything below it is structure.
- **Root-layer artefacts constrain matching; child-layer artefacts do not.** An artefact (such as `isMono`) in the rule's root layer must be matched in the host; one in a child/conclusion layer is structure and is created in the host root on application.
- **Child-layer equalities are never required** for matching; they are re-created in the host when the rule is applied.
- **Root-layer equalities are required**: matched images must be provably equal in the host.
- **The `checkLayerProvable` consistency matcher always behaves as injectivity off + flexible on**: it never enforces injectivity and always allows dependencies to match up to provable equality.
- **Applying merges the conclusion into the host root**, including conclusion-layer tag artefacts (e.g. `isMono`).
- **Second-order application builds one derived drawing per premise** that copies the host root (minus conclusion content) plus the premise layer and its child layer, without rule marking.
